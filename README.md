#### Description:
Our team has decided to develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to publish reviews of their favorite restaurants, sharing some elements of how Yelp functions. In terms of the system’s quantitative and qualitative functionalities, the application’s main purpose is to assist users in finding several restaurants around their area for the sake of choosing which restaurants to dine at. Site users can either surf the web application freely as a non-registered user or registered user by creating an account, where all accounts that have been activated are kept in a database.
 On a further note, users who create accounts with us gain the benefit of providing ratings based off a 1-5 scale, writing informative reviews on the restaurants they have visited, in which these reviews could be utilized to augment the overall performance of the reviewed restaurants. Reviews of restaurants left by users can also be given a like (if a user finds the review beneficial) or a dislike (if a user finds the review unprofessional or inconvenient ). The web application will also have the option of displaying restaurants in several sorted methods, in which for instance, high rated restaurant will be located at the top of the list and restaurants with low ratings will be at the bottom of the list.  To enhance user experience, the application will also list details associated to the restaurant such as hours of operation, business informations like acceptance of credit card and parking information.
